The code here includes various bits for the INFO 664: Programming for Cultural Heritage with Matt Miller at Pratt Institute, spring 2020. The intent of the project was to create a Twitter bot that regularly posts a cross-stitch pattern of objects in the Brooklyn Museum collection. It didn't quite make it there yet, but it's a work in progress.

What this stuff can do at the moment:

bkmus_api folder:

bkmus_api_objects.py 

This will create a json file of the metadata for all the objects in the Brooklyn Museum collection. First, apply for an API key here: https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api/register Then input your key into the config.template file, and save as config.py.

The other files (bkmus_artists.py, bkmus_collection.py, bkmus_copyr.py, bkmus_id.py, bkmus_image.py, bkmus_rights.py, bkmus_title.py) print the corresponding metadata from the json file.

bkmus_xstitch folder:

To convert images from Brooklyn Museum collection to cross-stitch patterns, and then to PNG files that can be uploaded to Twitter:

1. Download images from URLs generated by bkmus_image.py using img_from_url.py
2. Convert image to cross stitch using https://github.com/mbakija/Python_Cross_Stitch
3. Convert cross stitch pattern and key from SVG to PNG using svg_png.py

twitter_bot folder:

Is a work in progress, but twitter_bot.py can post lines from a TXT file to a Twitter account. Apply for Developer access to create an App to gain credentials here: https://developer.twitter.com
Then copy Consumer Key/Secret and Access Key/Secret to credentials.template and save as a new file named credentials.py
